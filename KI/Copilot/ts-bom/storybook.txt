I am creating a TypeScript program. My sourcecode should be in src, the compiled code in dist. What do I have to put in tsconfig?

I want to have a build and a start script in package.json. Write it for me.

ctrl + i: start should do a build first (show code alteration)

ctrl + i: What do I need to change to get incremental build?

ctrl + shift + i: There is an extension to create gitignore files. I forget it. Which is it?

ctrl + shift + i: In German, there is a word "Baugruppe" representing some parts put together, but used itself as a part in larger products. What would you call that in EN?

export type Part = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
}

export type PartOrAssembly = Part | Assembly;

export type Assembly = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    parts: {
        component: PartOrAssembly;
        quantity: number;
    }[];
}

Generate some sample data for an Assembly representing a simple bike.

Nice. Make the wheels assemblies, too (nested data structure)

function generate_bill_of_material(assembly: Assembly, quantity: number): {id: string, name: string, quantity: number}[]

Seems that I need this type multiple times. Create a named type for it and change my code accordingly.

This implementation returns multiple object in result for the same part. Make sure that parts in the result are unique and the quantity is aggregated accordingly.

I want to add  unit testing to my project. Which testing framework do you recommend?

npm install -D jest ts-jest
npx ts-jest config:init
testMatch: ["**/?(*.)+(spec|test).ts"],

@workspace /tests Generate jest unit test for generate_bill_of_material

should return an empty array when given an empty assembly

should return a single part when given an assembly with a single part

should return a single part when given an assembly that contains a single sub-part twice

should return two parts when given an assembly that contains two different parts

should handle a part that appears in two different sub-assemblies

should not return sub-assemblies, only parts
